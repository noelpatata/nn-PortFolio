# Web portfolio
## Purpose
I'm doing this small React js + Tailwind project because I want to learn these kind of technologies since I'm mostly specialized in backend.
I dont mean to "flex" my humble frontend skills because of the simple fact that its not my vibe. I just think that a software developer without a web portfolio is like a taxi without a drivers license.
## Technologies involved
- React
- TypeScript
- NextJS
